    # This filter looks-up info about CRIC metadata from the ATLAS-CRIC endpoint. A script reads from the 
    # ATLAS-CRIC endpoint and generates a MaxMind DB (mmdb) file. MMDB files organize IPs into
    # binary trees for fast searches. The geoip logstash filter only knows
    # how to interpret certain MaxMind DBs like the City DB so we have to fake things
    # to look like the CityDB by putting a JSON string in the "city_name" and then
    # expanding the JSON here in logstash.
